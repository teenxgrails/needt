/* THE PRODUCT'S NOTIFICATIONS, in the corner the design speaks from.

 * `NeedtCorner` composes the stack with `ChatCorner`, the design's chat pill.
 * The application already has a companion and a chat overlay of its own in
 * that corner, so only the stack is mounted here — two pills would be two
 * products.
 *
 * `.needt-v2` with a `data-theme` is the scope the design's tokens resolve
 * in, and `.nf-stack` is positioned against the nearest positioned ancestor,
 * so this supplies both. The frame takes no pointer events; the cards inside
 * it take their own.
