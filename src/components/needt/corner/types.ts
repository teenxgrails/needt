/* THE CORNER'S CONTRACT.
 *
 * The prototype fired notifications through `window.__notify({kind, title,
 * body, when, acts, ms, sticky})`. The global was an artefact of classic
 * scripts — there was no other way for one file to reach another — and it is
 * dropped here for a context and a hook. The PAYLOAD survives unchanged,
 * because that shape is the contract every caller was written against.
 *
 * `acts` carry `say` to run the agent or `go` to move the app; a notice may
 * carry both kinds of act, and the corner runs whichever the act names.

 * — the corner has one voice, so an action and a sentence go the same way.
 * `go` names a screen for the app to move to.
