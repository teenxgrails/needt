/* THE EXPOSURE AXIS — pure maths, no DOM.
 *
 * `ExposureWordmark` drives a single variable-font axis, `EXPO` (−100…+100,
 * resting 0), and does it by writing straight to the element every frame
 * (PORT.md §8) — so the numbers that decide WHAT to write have to be provable
 * on their own, with nothing about React or the DOM in the way. This module
 * is that proof: five generators, a torch target, and a spring step, each a
 * function of time rather than of a component's lifecycle.
 *
 * The font is duplexed — every axis position shares one advance width — so
 * none of this has to reason about layout. It only ever produces a number.
 *
 * Negative is ink flooding the counters; positive is light burning the
 * strokes away. Breathe only ever inks (0 → depth → 0, depth negative);
 * pulse only ever burns (0 → peak → 0, peak positive). That opposition is
 * the whole idea of the mark, and it is asserted in the tests below rather
 * than left to be noticed.
