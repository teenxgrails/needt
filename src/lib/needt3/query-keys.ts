/**
 * TanStack Query keys for design v3 (docs/port/02-task-plan.md §2.3).
 *
 * Every key starts with "v3", so the new screens never share a cache entry
 * with the old ones (`["tasks"]` in src/hooks/useTaskMutations.ts and
 * friends). A list key is a prefix of its filtered variants, so
 * `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: qk.tasks() })` refreshes every filter.
