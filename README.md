## Flowday Fork

This repository is being shaped into **Flowday**, a single-user Motion-style planner.

What this fork adds:

- Single-user mode with public signup, team, and billing surfaces disabled.
- Apple / iCloud Calendar through the existing CalDAV integration using `https://caldav.icloud.com` and an app-specific password.
- Smart scheduling data for energy requirements, priorities, deadlines, chunking, frozen blocks, dependencies, energy profiles, and ADHD-friendly scheduling preferences.
- A pure deterministic scheduler in `src/services/scheduling/engine.ts` that respects dependencies, busy blocks, energy windows, chunks, buffers, hard stops, and overcommitment.
- Optional AI assistant settings for Anthropic, OpenAI, or a custom local endpoint. Provider `None` is the default and keeps scheduling offline.
- ADHD planning panel on the calendar with brain dump parsing, energy timeline, overcommitment warning, time-blindness buffer visibility, quick reschedule, and shutdown ritual.
- Dense dark planner shell, command palette shortcuts, and a local connector API for external tools.

Key docs:

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Environment template](ENV_TEMPLATE.md)
- [Custom AI contract](docs/custom-ai-contract.md)
- [Connector API](docs/connector-api.md)
- [Deploy to Vercel + Neon](docs/deploy.md)

Local run:

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run prisma:generate
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`. The app expects PostgreSQL at `DATABASE_URL`; `docker compose up db -d` starts the bundled database when Docker is available.

Optional configuration:

- Google and Outlook OAuth credentials can be supplied in Settings or env vars.
- Apple/iCloud is configured from Settings -> Accounts -> Apple / iCloud Calendar.
- AI keys are entered in Settings -> AI Assistant and encrypted before storage.
- Connector token is generated in Settings -> Connectors and used as a bearer token.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Prisma for database management
- FullCalendar for calendar UI
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version specified in `.nvmrc`)
- PostgreSQL 15 or newer (the bundled `docker-compose.yml` uses PostgreSQL 16; if you point `DATABASE_URL` at your own database, it must be PostgreSQL 15+)
- A Google Cloud Project (for Google Calendar integration)

## Google Cloud Setup

To enable Google Calendar integration:

1. Create a Project:

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Click "New Project" and follow the prompts
   - Note your Project ID

2. Enable Required APIs:

   - In your project, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for and enable:
     - Google Calendar API
     - Google People API (for user profile information)

3. Configure OAuth Consent Screen:

   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   - Choose "External" user type
   - Fill in the required information:
     - App name: "FluidCalendar" (or your preferred name)
     - User support email
     - Developer contact information
   - Add scopes (these match what FluidCalendar actually requests):
     - `openid`
     - `email`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks` _(used for Google Tasks sync)_
   - Add test users if in testing mode

4. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:

   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Choose "Web application"
   - Set Authorized JavaScript origins:
     - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
     - Your production URL (if deployed)
   - Set Authorized redirect URIs (add **both** paths - one is used for Google sign-in, the other for connecting a calendar):
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (for development)
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/calendar/google` (for development)
     - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google` (for production)
     - `https://your-domain.com/api/calendar/google` (for production)
   - Click "Create"
   - Save the generated Client ID and Client Secret

   > These are the same two redirect URIs the in-app **Settings > System** panel shows for your deployment, so the app and these instructions match. Replace the host with the exact URL you open FluidCalendar at.

5. Configure Credentials:
   - Go to FluidCalendar Settings > System
   - Enter your Google Client ID and Client Secret in the Google Calendar Integration section
   - Or set environment variables as fallback:
     ```bash
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
     ```

### Troubleshooting the Google connection

If Google returns `Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch` or "Invalid Redirect" when you connect:

- **`NEXTAUTH_URL` must match the public URL you open in the browser.** The OAuth redirect host is derived from `NEXTAUTH_URL` (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`). If `NEXTAUTH_URL` is still `http://localhost:3000` but you reach the app at a different URL, Google is sent back to `localhost` and the connection fails. Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the exact public URL and restart the app.
- **Register both redirect URIs.** Google rejects the request if the exact callback URL is not in the authorized list. Make sure both `…/api/auth/callback/google` and `…/api/calendar/google` are listed for your host (see step 4 above).
- **Google does not accept bare private IP addresses (e.g. `http://192.168.1.150:3000`) or `.local` hostnames** as redirect URIs ("must end with a public top-level domain"). For local development use `localhost`; otherwise expose the app on a public domain (a reverse proxy or tunnel) and use that domain in both `NEXTAUTH_URL` and the Google redirect URIs.

Note: For production deployment, you'll need to:

- Verify your domain ownership
- Submit your application for verification if you plan to have more than 100 users
- Add your production domain to the authorized origins and redirect URIs

## Microsoft Outlook Setup

To enable Outlook Calendar integration:

1. Create an Azure AD Application:

   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)
   - Click "New registration"
   - Name your application (e.g., "FluidCalendar")
   - Under "Supported account types", select "Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)"
   - Click "Register"

2. Configure Platform Settings:

   - In your registered app, go to "Authentication"
   - Click "Add a platform"
   - Choose "Web"
   - Add Redirect URIs (this is the exact callback path FluidCalendar uses for Outlook - it must match with no trailing slash):
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/calendar/outlook` (for development)
     - `https://your-domain.com/api/calendar/outlook` (for production)
   - Under "Implicit grant", check "Access tokens" and "ID tokens"
   - Click "Configure"

3. Add API Permissions:

   - Go to "API permissions"
   - Click "Add a permission"
   - Choose "Microsoft Graph"
   - Select "Delegated permissions"
   - Add the following permissions:
     - `Calendars.ReadWrite`
     - `Tasks.ReadWrite`
     - `User.Read`
     - `offline_access`
   - Click "Add permissions"
   - Click "Grant admin consent" (if you're an admin)

4. Create Client Secret:

   - Go to "Certificates & secrets"
   - Click "New client secret"
   - Add a description and choose expiry
   - Click "Add"
   - Copy the generated secret value immediately (you won't be able to see it again)

5. Configure Credentials:
   - Go to FluidCalendar Settings > System
   - Enter your Outlook credentials in the Outlook Calendar Integration section:
     - Client ID (Application ID)
     - Client Secret
     - Tenant ID (Optional - leave empty to allow any Microsoft account)
   - Or set environment variables as fallback:
     ```bash
     AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
     AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
     AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id-or-common"
     ```

Note: For production deployment:

- Update the redirect URIs to include your production domain
- Ensure all required permissions are granted
- Consider implementing additional security measures based on your needs

## Installation

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

1. Install Docker on your machine
2. Clone the repository (or just download the docker-compose.yml file):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dotnetfactory/fluid-calendar.git
   cd fluid-calendar
   ```

3. Copy the example environment file and configure it:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file and set at minimum these values:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://fluid:fluid@db:5432/fluid_calendar
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-key
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Visit http://localhost:3000

That's it! The application will be running with a PostgreSQL database automatically configured. The docker-compose.yml file is already configured to use the pre-built Docker image.

> **Note on the port:** the container listens on `0.0.0.0:3000`, which `docker-compose.yml` pins via `environment: PORT=3000` and `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0`. Setting `PORT` or `HOSTNAME` in your `.env` will **not** change where the app binds (compose overrides them) - this avoids the app binding to a different port or to a loopback address than the one published. To serve on a different host port, change the host side of the `ports` mapping in `docker-compose.yml` (for example `"8080:3000"` to use `http://localhost:8080`) **and** update `NEXTAUTH_URL` (and the other browser-facing URLs - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) in your `.env` to the same host/port, since the app derives its OAuth redirect URLs from `NEXTAUTH_URL`; leaving it on `:3000` while browsing on `:8080` breaks sign-in and calendar auth.

### For Developers

If you want to develop FluidCalendar:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dotnetfactory/fluid-calendar.git
   cd fluid-calendar
   ```

2. Start the development environment:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

3. Visit http://localhost:3000

The development environment includes:

- Hot reloading
- PostgreSQL database
- Development tools
- Exposed database port (5432) for direct access

### Useful Docker Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker compose down

# Update to the latest version
docker pull eibrahim/fluid-calendar:latest
docker compose up -d

# Reset database (caution: deletes all data)
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d

# Access database CLI
docker compose exec db psql -U fluid -d fluid_calendar
```

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure the following environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your application URL
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Random string for session encryption

Note: Google credentials and logging settings can be managed through the UI in Settings > System. Environment variables will be used as fallback if system settings are not configured.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
