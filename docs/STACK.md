# Needt stack and release contract

Needt is a multi-user Next.js 15 application with separate BullMQ worker and
Hocuspocus collaboration processes built from the same commit and production
image.

## Runtime

- Node.js 22, npm only (`package-lock.json` is authoritative).
- Next.js App Router, React 19, TypeScript.
- PostgreSQL 16 through Prisma.
- Redis 7 for BullMQ, rate limits, lockouts, alert throttling, and realtime
  coordination.
- Hocuspocus 4 and one lockfile-pinned Yjs runtime for Pages and Moodboards;
  authorization and smoke requirements live in
  [`docs/collaboration.md`](collaboration.md).
- NextAuth credentials, Google, and Microsoft OAuth.
- Sentry in the Next.js client/server/edge runtimes and the worker.
- Web Push through VAPID with email fallback through Resend.

Install locally with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`. Docker and CI run
`npm ci`; `.npmrc` carries the peer-dependency compatibility setting.

## Required quality gates

`next build` intentionally does not run TypeScript or ESLint validation. Every
change must independently pass:

1. `npm run type-check`
2. `npm run lint`
3. `npm run test:unit`
4. `npm run test:e2e`
5. visual/style suites when UI, CSS, tokens, or shared components change
6. `npm run build`
7. `npm run build:worker`
8. `npm run build:collaboration`
9. the production Docker build

GitHub Actions exposes required `security`, `quality-gates`, `schema-drift`,
`e2e`, and conditionally executed `visual-style` statuses. Production
publishing is triggered only by a successful CI run on `main`.

`npm run check:branding` is part of CI. Product copy and internal event names
use Needt only; legal attribution is the explicit exception.

`npm run check:ui-contracts` protects the release-level UI invariants: one
picker, flat Focus, isolated Today scrollers, draggable assistant affordances,
the notification facade, Dim migration, and the stable GHCR image name.

## Shared UI contracts

`src/components/ui/needt-picker.tsx` is the only product picker. It covers
plain, searchable, and creatable single-select flows and switches from an
anchored desktop popover to a mobile bottom sheet. Theme IDs are `paper`,
`warm`, `dim`, `dark`, and `system`; persisted `gray` and `graphite` are
normalized to `dim` when read.

Calendar positioning is centralized in
`src/lib/calendar-scroll-policy.ts`; period arithmetic and interaction guards
live in `src/lib/calendar-navigation.ts`. Data refreshes must not invoke the
scroll policy or reset a user's manual vertical position.

The Today route locks to the app viewport and renders the ported Needt Home
surface against authenticated, server-authorized workspace data. Desktop and
mobile keep independent responsive compositions; task and habit writes require
Editor access, and unfinished fixture-only forms stay out of production.

Focus is rendered as a single flat, state-stable canvas in
`src/components/focus/FocusTimerPanel.tsx`. The server remains authoritative
for session phase and elapsed time; the client keeps timer feedback, duration
scrubbing, and the throttled live countdown in one consistent geometry.

The AI companion stores normalized coordinates through
`src/lib/assistant-position.ts`, so resize and orientation changes preserve the
relative position while reapplying sidebar, mobile-dock, and safe-area bounds.
All product notifications call `src/lib/notifications.ts`; direct Sonner calls
are restricted to that facade and the shared Toaster implementation.

## Multi-user isolation

Scheduling runs, idempotency records, focus data, dependencies, reminders,
push subscriptions, nudges, booking pages, and bookings are keyed by `userId`
or owner ID. All authenticated APIs validate ownership server-side.
FREE/PRO/LIFETIME restrictions are server-enforced in `src/lib/entitlements.ts`;
hidden UI is never the security boundary.
Browser caches, offline snapshots and queued writes follow the scoped purge and
replay contract in [`docs/offline.md`](offline.md).

## Deployment order

Web and worker use expand/contract deployment:

1. take/verify a database backup;
2. deploy web from the exact green SHA; its fail-fast entrypoint applies the
   additive migrations before accepting traffic;
3. wait until `/api/health` reports that SHA and a healthy database, then deploy
   worker and collaboration from the same SHA;
4. run the release gate and inspect `/admin/operations`;
5. enable feature flags only after the smoke test;
6. contract/remove old fields only after at least one fallback release.

Production runs **prebuilt images**. `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`
builds web (`production` target), worker and collaboration from the root
`Dockerfile` in GitHub Actions and pushes them to
`ghcr.io/teenxgrails/needt-{web,worker,collaboration}:<full SHA>`. Each Coolify
resource uses the Docker Image build pack; `scripts/coolify-deploy-image.sh`
sets its image tag through the Coolify API and asks for a deploy, so the
production host only pulls and restarts. Building there used to cost ~17
minutes of CPU per merge on the same four cores as Postgres, and two outages
when builds overlapped.

- The release SHA reaches the image as the `NEEDT_BUILD_SHA` build argument;
  `/api/health` checks it. A Coolify source build still works as a fallback
  through `SOURCE_COMMIT` (**Source commit availability → Available during
  build**).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined into the browser bundle at build time, so
  they live as GitHub `production` environment **variables**, not in Coolify.
  The `images` job fails if one is empty.
- A merge that touches only documentation (`docs/`, `openspec/`, `.agents/`,
  `.claude/`, `design-refs/`, `*.md`) since the SHA production serves does not
  release.
- Roll back with `gh workflow run docker-publish.yml -f rollback_sha=<sha>`
  (optionally `-f services=web|runtimes`). It redeploys the published tag
  without building. Migrations only move forward, so this is safe only across
  additive schema changes.
- The server pulls from GHCR with a read-only `read:packages` login made once
  over SSH (`docker login ghcr.io`).
