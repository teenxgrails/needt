/**
 * Re-vendor the design tokens from a downloaded Claude Design bundle.
 *
 *   npm run tokens:sync            # bundle at the repo root
 *   npm run tokens:sync -- <path>  # bundle somewhere else
 *
 * Why this is a script and not a copy: the bundle gets re-downloaded every time
 * the design changes, so any hand edit to the vendored output becomes an
 * unmergeable conflict on the next download. Everything the port needs to change
 * about these files is expressed here, once.
 *
 * WHAT IT REWRITES, AND WHY IT MUST
 *
 * The design system declares its tokens on `:root`, `.dark` and `.dim` — the
 * same selectors this repository already uses. Nine names collide, and four of
 * them are fatal rather than merely confusing:
 *
 *     --background  --foreground  --border  --destructive
 *
 * Tailwind consumes those four as HSL triplets, `hsl(var(--background))`. The
 * design system puts a hex in them. `hsl(#fcfdfe)` is invalid, so the
 * declaration is dropped and the element paints transparent — silently, with no
 * console error, in one theme at a time. That would take out 194 shadcn utility
 * usages across 43 files.
 *
 * So the vendored tokens are scoped under `.needt-v2` instead of landing on the
 * document root. Inside that subtree the new design is authoritative; outside
 * it, the existing app is untouched. When every screen is ported the scope is
 * removed in one commit and the shadcn block goes with it.
