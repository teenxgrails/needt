## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added spring-based task dragging with a Motion-style lift preview, reduced-motion fallbacks, and direct Today-sidebar drops onto the Day and Week calendar grids.
- Added a lightly staggered spring settle animation when auto-scheduling moves task chips into their new calendar slots.
- Added reduced-motion-aware number transitions for task counts, project alerts, focus stats, tracked time, and planning capacity.
- Added reduced-motion-aware list transitions for task tables, project boards, and the Today sidebar so optimistic changes settle smoothly without delaying input.
- Added instant optimistic task creation, editing, completion, movement, and deletion across Tasks, Calendar, Focus, Smart Planning, and project drag-and-drop, with server reconciliation and automatic rollback when a request fails.
- Added Motion-style calendar creation: clicking or dragging an empty Week/Day time slot now opens a lightweight task-first quick creator. Press Enter to create an auto-scheduled task, choose Event for a fixed block, or open the full Task editor for advanced options.
- Rebuilt the Event creator as a full Motion-style, two-column editor with time controls, repeat settings, and a dedicated Event details panel.
- Restored the month mini-calendar in the left sidebar (above the navigation list). Clicking a day moves the main calendar, the ‹ › arrows change month, today is shown with an accent-filled pill, and the selected day with a grey pill
- Added a "Today's tasks" panel in the left sidebar listing incomplete tasks that are overdue or due today, sorted most-urgent first with a colored urgency circle (red for overdue/due soon and pinned to the top, yellow for approaching, green for plenty of time). Hovering a row reveals an animated circular start button that opens a "Start task now" modal — choose how long to work (5–120 min), optionally start Focus, and the block is allocated now while the scheduling engine moves other tasks around it. Chosen durations are learned per task title so similar new tasks are prefilled. Urgency thresholds are configurable under Settings → Task urgency

### Changed

- Recolored the calendar canvas and time gutter to #1B1D1E, with subtle stepped shades for non-current working and non-working hours while preserving every grid line.
- Rebuilt calendar task and event cards in Motion’s grid language: tasks are neutral, checkbox-led blocks with compact time metadata and a hover actions affordance; events retain a restrained color marker and their own event-specific layout.
- Matched the Task and Event editors more closely to Motion’s actual layouts: Task now uses a wide, borderless editing canvas with property rows in the scheduling sidebar; Event uses Motion’s compact single-column creation flow with time controls, repeat controls, and Event details below.
- Reorganized Settings into grouped Calendars, Scheduling, Tasks, Appearance, Notifications, AI, Integrations, Import / Export, and Account pages; legacy hashes now route to their consolidated home.
- Moved calendar display and working-hour controls out of Calendars so calendar account/default-calendar settings have a single home.
- Consolidated calendar account management under Calendars, added an Account profile page, and restyled Tasks, Notifications, Import / Export, Integrations, and Logs with consistent Motion-style settings rows.
- Removed duplicate legacy energy and work-hours editors so scheduling rules have one source of truth; Appearance now owns the calendar working-hours display toggle.
- Moved the AI Chat button from the top of the sidebar to the bottom-left, just above the profile/settings row (keeps the pill styling and ⌘/ label)
- Made switching between app sections instant: the calendar route no longer blocks on a server-side query of every event on each navigation. It now renders as a static, prefetched route and hydrates from the persistent in-memory calendar store, revalidating in the background — so revisiting the calendar shows cached data immediately with no spinner or flash

### Fixed

- Fixed calendar task quick views for auto-scheduled chunks: click handlers now resolve the underlying task id instead of the generated calendar-block id, and the popover anchors to the clicked item.
- Removed the wide highlighted band that appeared across the whole hovered hour in the calendar (the app-wide `table tbody tr:hover` highlight was bleeding into FullCalendar's timegrid rows); the thin Motion-style dashed cursor guide is now the only hover affordance
- The dashed cursor guide in week view spans the full grid width (all day columns) and shows consistently over working hours, non-working hours, and every day, matching Motion
- Restored the calendar grid lines (hourly rows and day-column separators at `#2B2F31`, half-hour lines hidden) and added Motion-style column shading: the current-day column stays flat `#202425`, while other days show a two-step tint — working hours `#24282A`, non-working hours `#282C2E`

### Changed

- Redesigned the calendar toolbar and week grid to match the Motion reference: the header now shows a compact "Mon YYYY" title, and the right side groups a "Calendar options" menu (24-hour time, start week on Monday, highlight working hours), a "Refresh all tasks" action, a "+" new-event button, and a single "Week" view-switcher dropdown (replacing the separate Day/Week/Month/Year buttons). Week day headers now read "Mon 6" and a timezone abbreviation is shown in the top-left axis corner

### Added

- Import tasks from CalDAV servers (Baikal, Nextcloud, Fastmail, etc.): a connected CalDAV account's task collections (calendars that expose `VTODO`) can be mapped to a project and their tasks imported into FluidCalendar. Import is one-way for now - title, description, due/start dates, status, priority, and recurrence are read from the server, and an external-owned field cleared upstream (e.g. a completed task reopened) is cleared locally too so the import mirrors the server (#144)
- Create a multi-day all-day event by dragging the mouse across multiple days on the all-day row, like Google Calendar; the New Event modal opens pre-filled as an all-day event spanning the selected days (#79)
- Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with repository-wide guidance for GitHub Copilot's coding agent (setup, commands, architecture, SAAS/open-source separation, code-style conventions)
- Show the application version in a footer on every page, linking to the project's GitHub page (#111)

- API endpoint to verify Stripe checkout sessions
- Refactored the lifetime subscription success page (`src/app/(saas)/subscription/lifetime/success/page.tsx`) to use the new pattern for `searchParams` and `params` as Promise types, updating usages accordingly.
- Added a password setup page at /subscription/lifetime/setup-password for new users after successful payment (SAAS only).
- Updated the 'Set Up Your Account' button on the lifetime success page to redirect to the password setup page.
- The 'Set Up Your Account' button now sends name and email in query params to the password setup page, which displays them if present.
- Implemented backend API route and service for password setup at /subscription/lifetime/setup-password/api (SAAS only).
- Added client service to call the backend API for password setup.
- Integrated password setup form with the backend using Tanstack Query, including loading, error, and success states.
- Made `/subscription/lifetime/success` route public in middleware so it no longer requires authentication after successful payment.
- Made `/subscription/lifetime/setup-password` route public in middleware so users can set their password after payment without authentication.
- Enhanced lifetime subscription success page with automatic user verification and redirection
- Added subscription status verification and automatic updates for existing users
- Improved payment verification with early bird discount detection
- Updated LifetimeSuccessPage and LifetimeSuccessClient to show 'Go to login' or 'Go to Calendar' for existing users after successful lifetime subscription payment, based on whether the user is logged in or not. The setup button is now only shown for new users.
- Added a dismissible "Buy Lifetime Access" banner at the top of the main calendar/dashboard view for SAAS users who have not purchased lifetime access. The banner links to /beta for payment.
- The "Upgrade to Lifetime Access" banner is now only shown if the user does not have a lifetime subscription. Added `/api/subscription/lifetime/status` endpoint for this check.
- Fixed "Upgrade to Lifetime Access" banner to remain hidden initially until verification confirms user doesn't have lifetime access, preventing banner flash for lifetime subscribers
- Added Asia/Karachi to the timezone options in user settings

  - `STRIPE_LIFETIME_REGULAR_PRICE_ID`: Price ID for regular lifetime access
- Updated verifyPaymentStatus to include additional payment information
- Improved error handling and logging in subscription flow
- Improved SAAS/open source code separation:
  - Renamed subscription-related files to include `.saas.ts` extension:
    - `/src/lib/actions/subscription.ts` → `/src/lib/actions/subscription.saas.ts`
    - `/src/lib/services/subscription.ts` → `/src/lib/services/subscription.saas.ts`
    - `/src/lib/hooks/useSubscription.ts` → `/src/lib/hooks/useSubscription.saas.ts`
    - `/src/app/api/subscription/lifetime/route.ts` → `/src/app/api/subscription/lifetime/route.saas.ts`
    - `/src/app/api/subscription/lifetime/status/route.ts` → `/src/app/api/subscription/lifetime/status/route.saas.ts`
    - `/src/app/api/subscription/lifetime/verify/route.ts` → `/src/app/api/subscription/lifetime/verify/route.saas.ts`
    - `/src/app/(saas)/subscription/lifetime/success/page.tsx` → `/src/app/(saas)/subscription/lifetime/success/page.saas.tsx`

    - Modified Calendar component to use dynamic imports based on `isSaasEnabled` flag
    - Removed direct SAAS imports from common components

### Fixed

- Fixed deleting a single occurrence of a recurring Google Calendar event removing the wrong instance: single-occurrence deletes re-queried Google for the "next upcoming" instance (`timeMin: now`, `maxResults: 1`) and deleted that, so deleting a past or non-next row could silently delete a different (often future) occurrence. Single-mode deletion now targets the clicked occurrence directly. Affects all calendar views and pushed task blocks (#199)
- Fixed the Tasks list so sorting by the Priority or Energy column orders rows by meaning (low < medium < high) instead of alphabetically by label; tasks with no priority/energy (including the "None" priority) sort to the end (#131)
- Fixed CalDAV connection failures (unreachable server, DNS error, connection refused/timeout, or an untrusted/self-signed TLS certificate) being reported as "Failed to authenticate with CalDAV server. Please check your credentials." When the underlying failure is a network/TLS problem, the Test Connection, Connect, and calendar-discovery flows now return a connection-oriented error ("Could not connect to the CalDAV server. Please check the server URL, your network/firewall, and the server's TLS certificate.") with an HTTP 502, while genuine credential rejections still show the credentials message with HTTP 401. This stops sending users with Radicale/Nextcloud/Baikal down the wrong debugging path (#122, #117, #115)
- Fixed being unable to connect a second CalDAV server when its username matched one already connected: the account uniqueness constraint was `(userId, provider, email)` and CalDAV stores the login username in `email`, so two different CalDAV servers sharing a username collided and the second connection failed with a misleading "Incorrect credentials" error. CalDAV account identity now includes the server URL (`(userId, provider, email, caldavUrl)` with `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`), so multiple CalDAV servers can be connected even with the same username; OAuth providers (Google/Outlook) are unaffected and still allow only one account per email. Re-adding the exact same server now returns a clear "already connected" message instead of a credentials error (#145)
- Fixed the Docker quick-start being unreachable on `http://localhost:3000` when the operator's `.env` contained an unrelated `PORT` (e.g. `PORT=80`) or `HOSTNAME` (e.g. `localhost`): `docker-compose.yml` forwarded the whole `.env` into the app container, and the Next.js standalone server binds to `HOSTNAME:PORT`, so the app bound to the wrong address/port while compose still published `3000:3000`. The `app` service now pins `PORT=3000` and `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0`, so the published port always reaches a listening server; the README quick-start documents that `PORT`/`HOSTNAME` in `.env` do not change where the app binds (#151)
- Fixed connecting a personal Microsoft account (outlook.com / hotmail.com / live.com, Microsoft 365 Personal/Family) to Outlook failing with `profile-fetch-failed` after a successful sign-in; these accounts return `mail: null` from Microsoft Graph, so the account email now falls back to `userPrincipalName`. The "Connect Outlook" button is also no longer disabled when no Tenant ID is set (tenant is optional and defaults to `common`), and the Outlook redirect URI in the README, `docs/_old/outlook.md`, and the self-hosting checklist is corrected to the path the app actually uses (`/api/calendar/outlook`) (#97)
- Corrected the Google Calendar OAuth setup instructions so the README and the in-app System Settings panel agree: both now document the two required redirect URIs (`/api/auth/callback/google` for sign-in and `/api/calendar/google` for calendar connect), and the README adds troubleshooting for the common `redirect_uri_mismatch`/"Invalid Redirect" failures (`NEXTAUTH_URL` must match the public URL; bare private IPs and `.local` hosts are rejected by Google) (#76)
- Fixed CalDAV events created or updated in FluidCalendar appearing at the wrong time in other calendar clients (Thunderbird, Home Assistant) when their timezone differs from the server's. Timed events are now serialized with an explicit timezone (`DTSTART;TZID=<zone>` plus a generated `VTIMEZONE`, falling back to UTC `Z` when no timezone is known) instead of floating local time, so recurring events also keep their wall-clock time across DST and the `TZ` environment-variable workaround is no longer needed (#135)
- Fixed creating and updating all-day events on CalDAV servers (Baikal, Nextcloud) failing with an error; the generated iCalendar no longer emits an invalid duplicated `VALUE=date;VALUE=DATE` parameter on `DTSTART`/`DTEND` (#100)
- Fixed the "Hide upcoming tasks" filter on the Tasks list so it hides exactly the tasks marked "Upcoming"; it now uses the same day-granularity rule as the "Upcoming" badge instead of an instant comparison that also hid tasks starting later today (#109)
- Auto-Schedule settings time dropdowns (Working Hours and energy-level ranges) now honor the 12h/24h preference from General settings instead of always showing 24-hour times (#129)
- Improved all-day event UI by removing time selection when "All day" is checked, showing only date picker instead
- Fixed Google Calendar event deletion by adding missing userId parameter for authentication
- Fixed Outlook task sync issues with recurring tasks
- Fixed Caldav feed failing to add when syncToken is an integer
- Fixed: Updated Stripe checkout session success_url in lifetime subscription API to use double curly braces ({{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}}) so users are redirected to the success page after payment.
- Fixed lifetime subscription error toast to show the actual error message ("User already has lifetime access") instead of generic "request failed with status code 400" message.
- Fixed name input in account setup page after payment to allow users to enter their complete name without the input disappearing after first character.
- Fixed infinite login redirect loop in staging environment by:
  - Correcting the login URL from "/login" to "/auth/signin" in lifetime success page
  - Adding explicit handling in middleware to redirect "/login" to the correct authentication route
  - Preventing redirect loops between /auth/signin and /setup pages by improving middleware and setup check logic
  - Adding special handling in middleware to detect and break circular redirects
- Fixed edge case where sign-in button remained visible after user logged in by adding proper session loading state handling in UserMenu component
- Fixed calendar page authentication to use JWT tokens instead of session-based authentication, maintaining consistency with the rest of the application
- Fixed authentication in subscription API routes by replacing session-based auth with JWT tokens:
  - Updated `/api/subscription/lifetime/status` to use getToken instead of getServerSession
  - Updated `/api/subscription/lifetime/verify` to use getToken instead of getServerSession
  - Updated `/subscription/lifetime/success` page to use JWT token authentication
- Fixed all linting errors related to usage of 'any' in API routes for subscription lifetime status and verify endpoints.
- Refactored usage of getToken in (saas) subscription lifetime success page and API routes to use NextRequest and proper cookie handling.
- Replaced console.log with logger.error in (common)/calendar/page.tsx for proper logging.
