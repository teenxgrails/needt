## Context

The version string exists only in `package.json` (`"version": "0.1.0"`) and is not exposed to the client anywhere. All authenticated pages render through `src/app/(common)/layout.tsx`, a client component that renders `<AppNav />` (a top navbar) and a `<main className="relative flex-1">` inside a `flex min-h-screen flex-col` column. There is no footer component anywhere in `src/components`.

The repo reads public build-time configuration through `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`. `next.config.js` exposes the package version and uses the standard page extensions. The canonical GitHub URL is `https://github.com/dotnetfactory/fluid-calendar`.

The Jest config is Node-env with `testMatch: src/**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts` and no jsdom, so `.tsx` components cannot be rendered in tests; only pure `.ts` logic is unit-testable.

## Goals / Non-Goals

Goals:
- Show the app version on every page.
- Make the version a link that takes the user to the project's GitHub page.
- Keep the displayed version automatically in sync with `package.json` (no second place to bump).
- Make the version-resolution and link-building logic unit-testable.

Non-Goals:
- No new settings, API route, or persisted state.
- No SAAS-vs-OSS divergence (the version + GitHub link are identical in both builds, so no `.saas`/`.open` split).
- No redesign of the navbar; the footer is intentionally minimal and unobtrusive.

## Decisions

### Decision: Inject the version via `next.config.js` `env`, sourced from `package.json`

Add `env: { NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION: require("./package.json").version }` to the Next config. `NEXT_PUBLIC_`-prefixed env values are inlined into the client bundle by Next at build time, so the footer can read `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` on the client. Reading it from `package.json` at config-eval time means the single source of truth for the version stays `package.json` - bumping the package version updates the UI automatically.

Alternative considered: a hardcoded constant in a `version.ts` file. Rejected because it duplicates the version and will silently drift from `package.json`.

Alternative considered: importing `package.json` directly into a client component. Rejected - bundling the whole `package.json` into the client and relying on JSON import interop is heavier and less explicit than a single env value.

### Decision: Put version-resolution + URL logic in a pure `src/lib/version.ts`

The Node-only Jest env cannot render `.tsx`, so to get test coverage the testable logic lives in a plain module:
- `getAppVersion(): string` - returns `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` when set and non-empty, else a `"0.0.0"`-style fallback so the UI never renders an empty/`undefined` version.
- `getVersionGithubUrl(): string` - returns the GitHub URL the badge links to: always the repository root (`https://github.com/dotnetfactory/fluid-calendar`). A per-version `/releases/tag/v<version>` link was deliberately rejected because not every `package.json` version has a published GitHub release tag (e.g. `0.1.0` has no tag, while the repo's actual tags start at `v1.0.0`), so a tag-based link would 404 for the current build. The repo root is unambiguously "the github page" the issue asks for and always resolves.

The `VersionBadge.tsx` component is a thin consumer of these helpers; the test imports the helpers directly.

### Decision: Render a minimal footer in the `(common)` layout, plus the public homepage footer

The issue says "at the footer or somewhere" and "on all the pages". The single chokepoint for all authenticated pages (Calendar, Tasks, Focus, Settings, Setup, auth) is `(common)/layout.tsx`. Add a small `<footer>` after `<main>` (inside the `flex min-h-screen flex-col` column so it sits at the bottom) containing `<VersionBadge />`, right-aligned, muted, small text. This guarantees the version is present on every authenticated page without touching each page or restructuring the navbar.

The badge is an `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` (a plain anchor, not Next `<Link>`, since it points to an external site), styled with muted text and a hover state consistent with the navbar's other muted controls.

The one user-visible route outside `(common)` is the public open-source homepage `/` (`src/app/(open)/page.open.tsx`), whose `(open)` layout just returns `children`. That page already has its own marketing footer (gray palette, with a "Contribute on GitHub" link). Rather than force the muted-token `VersionBadge` into that differently-styled footer, the version is added inline into the existing homepage footer using the same `getAppVersion()` / `getVersionGithubUrl()` helpers, styled to match the page's existing footer link. This covers "every page" including the splash page while keeping each footer visually consistent with its surroundings.

The root failure pages `src/app/not-found.tsx` (404) and `src/app/error.tsx` (error boundary) render their own `<html>/<body>` and bypass every layout, so they need the version added directly. Each gets a small muted version link (same helpers) below its action buttons. These are special Next.js files, but they are user-visible screens, so covering them makes the "every page" guarantee literal rather than aspirational.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Risk: `next.config.js` is also evaluated for the worker/standalone build. `require("./package.json").version` is a plain synchronous read with no side effects, so it is safe in every config evaluation.
- Trade-off: the link goes to the repository root rather than a version-specific page. This is intentional - it guarantees the link always resolves (a tag-based link 404s for versions with no published release, including the current `0.1.0`) and matches the issue's request for "the github page".
- Trade-off: a footer adds a small amount of vertical chrome. Kept to a single short line of small muted text to stay unobtrusive.

## Migration Plan

None. Additive UI plus a build-time env value; no data, schema, or API migration.

## Open Questions

- None. The badge links to the repo root in all cases (see Decisions). A specific release-tag link was considered and rejected because it would 404 for versions with no published GitHub release.
